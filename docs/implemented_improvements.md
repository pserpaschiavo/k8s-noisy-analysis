# Implemented Improvements - Multi-tenant Analysis Pipeline

## 1. Implementation of Cross-Correlation (CCF)

### Improvements Made:
-   Added cross-correlation implementation in the `pipeline.py` file for generating CCF plots.
-   Replicated the same implementation in the `pipeline_new.py` file for consistency between pipelines.
-   Created the `docs/cross_correlation_analysis.md` document with detailed explanations on interpreting the analyses.
-   CCF plots are now generated and stored in `outputs/{experiment}/plots/correlation/cross_correlation/`.

### Benefits:
-   Identification of temporal relationships between tenants (who influences whom).
-   Detection of lag in relationships, indicating how long it takes for one tenant to affect another.
-   Better understanding of the "neighborhood effect" in multi-tenant Kubernetes environments.

## 2. Correction of the Insight Aggregation Stage

### Problems Fixed:
-   Fixed the issue that prevented the generation of insights when some intermediate data was not available.
-   Implemented robust logic to create basic data when necessary, allowing the pipeline to continue without failures.
-   Corrected typing errors that caused problems in data serialization to JSON.

### Benefits:
-   More resilient pipeline to incomplete data.
-   Consistent generation of insight reports.
-   Better identification of problematic tenants even with partial data.

## 3. Organization of Visualizations for Presentation

### Improvements Made:
-   Updated the `organize_presentation_visualizations.py` script to include cross-correlation plots.
-   Logically organized directory structure to facilitate presentation.
-   Intelligent selection of the most relevant plots for each category.

### Benefits:
-   More complete and organized presentation material.
-   Focus on the most important aspects of the analyses.
-   Inclusion of new visualizations without compromising clarity.

## 4. Documentation

-   Created an explanatory document on cross-correlation with an interpretation guide.
-   Included explanations of the metrics used and their relevance.
-   Added guidance for analyzing the results.

## Current Status

All improvements have been implemented and tested successfully. The pipeline now:
1.  Generates cross-correlation plots for all pairs of tenants.
2.  Reliably aggregates insights, even with incomplete data.
3.  Efficiently organizes visualizations for presentation.
4.  Provides detailed documentation on the new functionalities.

## Recommended Next Steps

1.  Integrate cross-correlation with anomaly detection for more accurate identification of noisy tenants.
2.  Implement statistical analysis of lags to determine the average propagation time of effects between tenants.
3.  Expand the documentation with more use cases and practical examples.
