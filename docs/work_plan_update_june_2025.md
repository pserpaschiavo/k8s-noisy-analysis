# Work Plan Update - June/2025

## New Implementations and Features

### 1. Flexibility in Specifying Input Data

- ✅ **Implementation of the `experiment_folder` parameter**: Added the ability to specify specific experiments within the `data_root` directory through this parameter.
  - Allows easy selection of which set of experiments to analyze without changing the entire `data_root`.
  - Implemented in the `get_experiment_folder` and `get_experiment_dir` functions in the `parse_config.py` module.

- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation**: Created detailed documentation on how to use the `experiment_folder` parameter:
  - `docs/experiment_folder_guide.md`: Complete guide with examples, technical explanations, and use cases.
  - `docs/README_experiment_folder.md`: Quick introduction for basic use.

- ✅ **Convenience scripts**: Created scripts to facilitate execution with different experiments:
  - `run_pipeline_with_experiment.py`: Wrapper script that correctly manages the `experiment_folder`.
  - `run_pipeline_3_rounds.py`: Specific script for the 3-round experiment.
  - `make_scripts_executable.sh`: Utility to ensure all scripts are executable.

- ✅ **Testing and validation**: Developed tests to ensure correct functionality:
  - `test_experiment_folder.py`: Basic test of the parameter.
  - `debug_experiment_folder.py`: Script for debugging issues.
  - `src/test_experiment_folder_parameter.py`: More in-depth unit tests.

### 2. Improvements in the Processing Pipeline

- ✅ **Flag propagation**: Ensured that the `experiment_folder_applied` flag is correctly propagated throughout the entire pipeline.
- ✅ **Path handling**: Robust implementation to avoid path duplication.
- ✅ **Integration with existing system**: Both the patch approach (in `pipeline_experiment_folder.py`) and directly via `DataIngestionStage` work harmoniously.

### 3. Implementation of Visualizations with Relative Time

- ✅ **Conversion to relative time**: Modified all visualization functions to display time in seconds from the beginning of each phase, instead of absolute timestamps.
  - Implemented in the visualization functions in `analysis_descriptive.py`, `analysis_anomaly.py`, and `analysis_sliding_window.py`.
  - Significant improvement in the readability and interpretability of the graphs.
  - Facilitates comparison between different phases and experiments.

- ✅ **Type corrections**: Added explicit conversions to appropriate numeric types to avoid `ArrayLike` type errors when using NumPy arrays with Matplotlib.
  - Use of `pd.to_numeric(...).to_numpy(dtype=float, na_value=np.nan)` to ensure compatibility.

- ✅ **Standardization of axis labels**: All X-axes in temporal visualizations now show "Time (seconds)" for consistency.

- ✅ **Complete validation**: Pipeline executed successfully using the 3-round configuration, confirming that all visualizations are correctly generating relative time.

### 4. Recommendations for Next Steps

1.  **Documentation expansion**: Add more usage examples in different scenarios.
2.  **Deeper integration**: Incorporate the `experiment_folder` functionality into all execution scripts.
3.  **UI/UX**: Consider complementing with a more user-friendly experiment selection interface.
4.  **Additional improvements to visualizations**: Consider options for customizing visualizations based on user needs.

## Impacts on System Architecture

This implementation represents an important step towards a more modular and flexible system, allowing for:

1.  Better organization of the dataset.
2.  Ease of comparing results between different experiments.
3.  Foundation for a future plugin/extension system.

The current architecture is prepared for the next development steps, including the consolidation of the unified plugin-based pipeline system.
