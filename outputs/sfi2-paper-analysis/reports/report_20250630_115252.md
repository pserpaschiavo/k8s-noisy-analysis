## Methodology

This report uses a multi-dimensional analysis methodology to identify tenants with the greatest impact:

1. **Causality Analysis**:
   - Granger Causality: Tests whether past values of one tenant help predict future values of another.
   - Transfer Entropy: Quantifies the directional information transfer between time series.

2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Measures the strength of the linear relationship between metrics of different tenants.
   - Higher values indicate greater interdependence.

3. **Phase Variation**:
   - Quantifies the magnitude of change in metrics during various noise phases (CPU, Memory, etc.) compared to the baseline.
   - Tenants with higher variation are considered to have a greater impact or be more sensitive to the noisy environment.

**The final score is calculated as a weighted average:**
- 50% Causal Impact (with higher weight for causality detected via Transfer Entropy)
- 30% Correlation Strength
- 20% Phase Variation

### Limitations of the Methodology

- Statistical causality does not necessarily imply direct physical causality.
- Correlation does not imply causation; it may reflect common external factors.
- The analysis assumes that the time series are adequately sampled and stationary.
